    The Opinions section often includes Point-Counter-Points and spreads that reflect a diverse set of beliefs and perspectives, 
    and use their stances to uncover a deeper understanding of the subject at hand. 
    The overarching goal is to create engaging, substantive, and relevant content to provide a closer look at the world.`,

        or family to a wider audience. With writing drafts and coming up with arguments, I’ve also seen myself grow as a writer, allowing me to support my 
        arguments more effectively. As teenagers, it’s easy to feel like our voices do not matter as much as adults, 
        but this department has allowed for many students’ voices to be recognized, and I find that very special.`,
